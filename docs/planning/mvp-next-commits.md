# MVP Next Commits Queue

Operational queue for one-task execution runs.

## Start Intent
- User sends any short "start work" nudge (`rob`, `rób`, `dzialaj`, `start`, `go`, `next`).
- Agent executes exactly one unchecked task from `NOW`.

## NOW

## NEXT
- [ ] `docs(sync): normalize planning files so roadmap/mvp/v1 statuses are fully consistent`

## BLOCKED
- [ ] `exit-gates(v1-production): SLO/incident/security/load/public-docs/launch-review criteria require production evidence and launch-cycle checkpoints`

## DONE
- [x] `chore(planning): initialize MVP/V1 execution plans and agent blueprint`
- [x] `chore(planning): align trigger intent to generic one-task nudge`
- [x] `chore(planning): historical done backlog archived in git history; queue reset for current delivery focus`
- [x] `docs(sync): reconcile roadmap immediate gaps with implemented runtime-stream status and evidence links`
- [x] `ops(slo): define MVP/V1 SLO set and add measurable targets + source metrics`
- [x] `ops(evidence): run production-like load baseline and attach results to v1 exit criteria`
- [x] `security(audit): run ownership/auth/key-flow verification pass and publish evidence summary`
- [x] `release(evidence): compile public docs pack and launch-readiness evidence checklist`
- [x] `ops(cutover): define local cutover checklist from legacy bot to new runtime`
- [x] `ops(cutover): define rollback checklist to legacy runtime`
- [x] `test(cutover): execute local replacement dry-run with realistic bot scenario`
- [x] `release(review): run 7-day launch retrospective and cut V1.1 backlog`

## Queue Rules
- Keep `NOW` at max 5 tasks.
- Keep one logical change per task.
- If task grows, split before coding.
- After completion, update this file and `docs/planning/mvp-execution-plan.md`.
